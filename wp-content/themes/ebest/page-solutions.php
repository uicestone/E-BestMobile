							<p>ALZHEIMER’S disease is incurable, and only barely treatable. Drugs such as Aricept bring temporary relief, but nothing halts its onward march. There was therefore a lot of excitement, among researchers and journalists alike, in the lead-up to a lecture given on July 22nd at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, in Washington, DC. The talk was entitled “Delayed Start Studies in the Assessment of Potential Disease Modifying Effect”. Translated into English, that meant the researchers presenting the paper, who work for Eli Lilly, a big pharmaceutical company, thought they had come up with something which slows down the illness’s progression.</p>

							<p>When Lilly tested the drug in 2012, they found little evidence of success—except in those with mild, early-onset Alzheimer’s, for whom there were hints that the progression of the disease had been slowed. But by extracting this group from the rest, and concentrating on them, the firm’s scientists have found something more hopeful.</p>

							<p>Their delayed-start trial worked like this. Three and a half years ago, the 1,300 qualifying patients were divided into two groups. One lot were put on solanezumab immediately. The others were given a placebo for the trial’s first 18 months, and thereafter switched to the real thing, which they have now been taking for two years.</p>
